## Tournament Simulation

A tournament simulation that takes 16 teams and places them up against each other. 

## How it works

The simulation starts with a random shuffle of the 16 teams and spreads them out into 4 groups called the group stage where they play each other in best of three matches. Once group stage finishes, the simulation takes the top team of every group and places them into the upper bracket and the second team of each group into the lower bracket. Once there are only 1 team in both upper and lower brackets, they play each other in a grand final where it is a best of five. The first team to reach 3 maps wins the tournament.
